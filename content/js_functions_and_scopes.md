# Functions and scopes in Javascript

I intended to write a summary about the various function invocation methods in
JS, but while doing my research, I've discovered incredible resources already
available.

Humbled by those findings, here are the most valuable. Unsurprisingly, the MDN
Docs are in.

* [Everything you wanted to know about Javascript scope](http://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/) by [Todd Motto](https://twitter.com/toddmotto)
* [Variable and function hoisting in Javascript](http://designpepper.com/blog/drips/variable-and-function-hoisting)
* [MDN - Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)
* [Function.prototype.bind - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)
* [Function.prototype.call - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call)
* [Function.prototype.apply - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply)

With all this in mind, you'll be able to understand most (if not all) of the
intricacies of Javascript. There are certainly many resources around as
valuable as the ones above, but I've found them enlightening and clearly
explained.

If the above resources were nothing new to you, good news: you've just found a
company that hires JS engineers with a deep knowledge of the language and its
ecosystem. Contact us!
